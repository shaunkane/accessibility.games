        <h1>Plink Game Examples</h1>
        <p>The following games demonstrate some of the features of the plink audio game library.</p>
        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>To start the game, click the link in your mobile and desktop browser, and follow the spoken instructions to start the game.</p>
        <p>Because of the security restrictions on some mobile browsers, including recent versions of iOS, plink games cannot play audio or speech until the user performs a tap gesture. Therefore on these platforms the game will not play any audio or speech
            when the game first loads. In these browsers, you must tap the screen to unlock the audio and continue the game.</p>
        <p>Each game begins with instructions. Note that these instructions may refer to pressing directional buttons or the A, B, and start buttons. How the game is controlled depends on the type of device being used. See the table below for mappings between
            plink game controller buttons and the keyboard keys or gestures that control them.</p>
        <table role="table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Button</th>
                    <th>Keyboard</th>
                    <th>Touch Screen</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>

                <tr>
                    <td>Up</td>
                    <td>up arrow</td>
                    <td>swipe up</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Down</td>
                    <td>down arrow</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>B</td>
                    <td>B key</td>
                    <td>tap with two fingers</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Start</td>
                    <td>Enter key</td>
                    <td>tap with three fingers</td>

        <h2>Maze</h2>

        <h2>Freesound</h2>
        <p>This is an example of how to quickly prototype audio games using plink. In this game, you hear the sound of a cat or dog and press a corresponding key (left for cats, right for dogs). This game dynamically fetches sound effects from Freesound
            so that no additional files are needed. This game also demonstrates stereo sound.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Rhythm Game</h2>
        <p>In this rhythm game, the player must follow directions and press specific buttons at the correct time. This game also demonstrates dynamic music and time-based events.</p>

        <h2>Boxing</h2>
        <p>In this game, the player boxes against a virtual character. The player must listen for oncoming attacks and press the arrow keys to dodge, then press A and B to punch. This game features HTML Canvas graphics alongside the audio interface. This
            game also demonstrates stereo sound and time-based events.</p>
