            <h1>Using Headers to Navigate</h1>
            <p>As you have seen, navigating through a web page with a screen reader takes time, as the user must listen to all of the text on the page. Even when the speech rate is set high, we don't currently have a way to skim through a document.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, screen readers allow the user to skip to various landmarks on a page. In this activity we'll use page headers (like the one above) to navigate.</p>
            <p>As before, you can turn on the virtual screen reader using <span class="hotkey">shift+S</span>, and you can navigate to the next line using <span class="hotkey">shift+arrow down</span> or <span class="hotkey">shift+arrow up</span> to read
                the previous line. Now you can also navigate through headers: press <span class="hotkey">H</span> to skip to the next header or <span class="hotkey">shift+H</span> to skip to the previous header. You can use these to skip to a later section,
                then use the arrows to navigate within that section.</p>
            <p>Try it out on the display below. Note that this time the text is hidden, so you need to navigate using the screen reader.</p>

                <h2>Grace Hopper</h2>
                <p>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (nee Murray; December 9, 1906 - January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I">Harvard Mark I computer</a>,
                    she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and the FLOW-MATIC programming language she created using this
                    theory was later extended to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>, an early high-level programming language still in use today.</p>
                <h2>Early life and education</h2>
                <p>In 1934, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale under the direction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ã˜ystein_Ore">Oystein Ore.</a> Her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissertation">dissertation</a>, "New Types of
                    Irreducibility Criteria", was published that same year. She began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.
                </p>
                <h2>Retirement</h2>
                <p>In accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_(United_States)">commander</a> at age 60 at the end of 1966. She was recalled to active
                    duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment. She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972. She was promoted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_(United_States)">captain</a>                    in 1973 by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.</p>
